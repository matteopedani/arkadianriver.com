	           <h2>PROJECT <br /> DESCRIPTION</h2> 
			     <p>Cryptmoon is a series that reveals the invisible clash of obscure energies that surrounds us and that can take possession of our conscience, leading us to commit extreme acts. 
                 <br/>
                 One of these forces is called Verbus: it enters the body of the protagonist and generates a double personality in him, but this is visible only to Crypt, his rival: a man who by means of Metaphonia - the recording of sounds that arrive from the spirit world - tries to intercept him and figure out his evil plans..</p>

            <br/>
            Only Crypt, a keen investigator of the occult, finds out about the evil plan that Verbus is proposing to Roberto…
